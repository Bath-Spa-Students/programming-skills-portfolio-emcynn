#Exercise 2: Greetings
#Start with the list you used in Exercise 1, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

#List of friends' names
names = ["Jhunnie", "Denzie", "Marvey", "Vernan"]

#Displaying their names with a message
print(f"Hello, " + names[0] + "!")
print(f"Hello, " + names[1] + "!")
print(f"Hello, " + names[2] + "!")
print(f"Hello, " + names[3] + "!")
