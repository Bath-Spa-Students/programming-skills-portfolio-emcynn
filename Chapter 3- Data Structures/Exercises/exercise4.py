#Exercise 4: Guest List 
#If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

#List of invited guests
guests = ["Maryel Angela", "Seif Ibrahim", "Heba Albari"]
