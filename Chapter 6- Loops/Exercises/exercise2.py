#Exercise 2: Movie Tickets
#A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is $15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost of their movie ticket

#Ask for the person's age 
prompt = "Enter the person's age (type 'quit' to exit):"

#Exit the loop if the user enters "quit"
while True:
    age = input(prompt)
    if age == 'quit':
        break
    age = int(age)

#Convert the input value into an integer
   
    if age < 3:
        print("  You get in free!")
    elif age < 13:
        print("  Your ticket is $10.")
    else:
        print("  Your ticket is $15.")
