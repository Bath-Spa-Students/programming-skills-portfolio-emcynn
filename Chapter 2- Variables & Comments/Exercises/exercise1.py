#Exercise 1: Variables
#Assign a message to a variable, and print that message. Then change the value of the variable to a new message and print the new message.

#Assigning & displaying the first message 
msg = "Python is very fun to use."
print(msg)

#Replacing the previous msg
msg = "There are lots of things you can do with it!"
print(msg)
