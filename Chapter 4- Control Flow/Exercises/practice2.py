#Practice Exercise 2
#Write an if-else statement that assigns O to the variable b if the variable a is less than 10. Otherwise, it should assign 99 to the variable b.

#Assigning a value to var a
a = 7  

#Initialize var b based on the condition
if a < 10:
    b = 0
else:
    b = 99

#Display the value of b
print("Value of b:", b)
