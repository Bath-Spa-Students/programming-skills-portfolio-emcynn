#Practice Exercise 1
#Write a python program with if statement that assigns 20 to the variable y and assigns 40 to the variable z if the variable & is greater than 100.

#Assume the variable & is given a value
x = 101

#Initialize variables
y = 0
z = 0

#Check if x is greater than 100
if x > 100:
    y = 20
    z = 40

# Print the values of y and z
print("y value:", y)
print("z value:", z)
