#Exercise 4:  Large Shirts
# Modify the make_shirt() function so that shirts are large by default with a message that reads I love Python. Make a large shirt and a medium shirt with the default message, and a shirt of any size with a different message.


def make_shirt(size='large', message='I love Python!'):
    print("\nI'm going to create a " + size + "-sized t-shirt.")
    print('Its text design will be, "' + message + '"')

#Call the function to make a large-sized shirt with the set default message
make_shirt()

#Call the function to make a medium-sized shirt with the set default message
make_shirt(size='medium')

#Call the function to make a medium-sized shirt with a different message
make_shirt('medium', 'Just do it')
